This is a site for the non-profit, Tampa Bay Harvest, for means of hosting a community of open-source development on the platform. 

The currently live site can be found at http://tampabayharvest.com. 

Major hurdles to overcome:

Currently a model for an ethereum-based web token is something which has some progress, however, creating a web3 strategy in Passport in order to make better use of Metamask is still up in the air and we'll continue utilizing mongodb for storing usernames/emails and passwords. 

Also, hosting a public 'food donated' ledger would prove to be difficult due to dependance on Metamask log ins so this info will just have to be input by hand. Automatic updates are then desirable and would have to be an internal process to then be served.

A disqus forum would be nice. 

This React/Redux leverages the technologies/packages as follows:

-axios
-bcrypt
-jsonwebtoken
-mongoose
