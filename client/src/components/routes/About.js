<h1>About 3Tampa Bay Harvest</h1>
   	<div>
	Tampa Bay Harvest, Inc ("TBH") is an all -volunteer 501(c)(3) charitable organization operating in West Central Florida including Pinellas and Hillsborough Counties. We function as a food recovery and gleaning organization.<br />
<br />
Our volunteers pick up leftover, sale dated and excess food items from local supermarkets, hospitals, schools, restaurants, as well as other food related businesses, delivering the rescued food to local area charities served by TBH who, in turn, feed the hungry.<br />
<br />
Since being formed in 1989 TBH volunteers have delivered millions of pounds of food to the local charities that serve the needy citizens of our community. That's high quality food that restaurants, fast food establishments, hospitals, schools, hotels, and caterers would have thrown away that was cycled back into the Tampa Bay area social service community thanks to the efforts of TBH volunteers.<br />
<br />
By recycling this food and using the same to feed the needy of the Tampa Bay area, TBH volunteers enable local charities to expand their services despite already stretched budgets. This donated food translates into millions of dollars that local charities can dedicate for other services such as&nbsp;continuing education, job training, day care and medical care, rather than using these funds to feed their agencies clientele.<br />
<br />
To meet its operating requirements, TBH maintains only one paid position, a full-time General Manager.  All other positions including its Board of Directors are filled by volunteers who use their homes, offices and private vehicles to complete their volunteer functions.  All operating needs, such as the General Manager's position, postage, photocopies, telephone costs, etc. are all fulfilled by  donations from the community.<br />
